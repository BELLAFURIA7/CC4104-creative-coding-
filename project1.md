The brief was to create a realtime clock in alternative and visually interesting way. I decided to create a rainfall simulator, where each second a drop of rain falls, and when it hits a minute the rainfall will increase and then decrease to one raindrop a second. I started off with the base of my code as a simple realtime clock, i took the code i used from the website GeeksforGeeks and i will link it below. 
[GeeksforGeeks - Basic realtime clock in p5.js](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-make-digital-clock-in-p5-js/)

I actually found that my code would work without the visual representation of the clock itself in the background, however, i decided to keep it to ensure it was clear how the time was changing.
